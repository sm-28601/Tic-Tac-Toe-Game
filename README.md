# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
A simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game built using Python. This game allows two players to take turns placing their marks ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play
1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script.
2. Players are prompted to input their moves by specifying position (e.g., `2`).
3. The game board updates after each move and displays the current state.
4. The game ends when a player forms a line of three marks or if all cells are filled (resulting in a draw).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
